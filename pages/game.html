			<h2>Ge’ez script</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>
				The Ge’ez script is used for different languages of Ethiopia and
				Eritrea, mostly Ethiopian semitic languages (Ge’ez, Amharic, Tigrinya,
				Tigre, Harari, Sebat Bet Gurage…), but also Cushitic, like Bilen, or
				Sudanic, like Me’en. It has started as an abjad, in which only the
				consonants are written, in its case 26 consonantal letters, and was used
				to write the Ge’ez language until 330 A.D. It then evolved to an
				abugida, or an alphasyllabary, in which each glyph represents a
				consonant-vowel sequence. As the vowels are represented as diacritics in
				an irregular way, it can be viewed as a syllabary of 287 syllables.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Ge’ez script numerals</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>
				The Ge’ez numerals, which are actually used to write Amharic numbers
				(like Arabic or Hindu-Arabic numerals are used for English numerals),
				were formed either by borrowing the Coptic numerals, or by using Ge’ez
				letters and adding a top and a bottom signs to indicate they were
				numerals or not letters, which is how Coptic and Greek numerals were
				formed. There is no symbol for zero, but specific symbols for the units
				(1-9), the tens (10-90), one for hundred, and another one for ten
				thousand, wich is a combination of the symbol for hundred (as 10,000 is
				100 multiplied by 100).
